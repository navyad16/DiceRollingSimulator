- Built a command-line based dice rolling simulator that mimics the behavior of a physical six-sided dice. 
- Each roll produces a random number from 1 to 6, allowing repeated rolls based on user input. 
- This project highlights the use of random number generation, loops, and user interaction.
  
- Key Features:
   Simulates a 6-sided dice roll using the random module
   Interactive loop with user input to roll again or exit
   Clear and user-friendly command-line interface
